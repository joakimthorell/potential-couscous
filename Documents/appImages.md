## CousCousDrive Android application


![Main](/Documents/Images/app/ccdMain.jpg)

The main view. Shown when application starts.

![Connect](/Documents/Images/app/ccdConnect.jpg)

Connect view. This will open when pressing the bluetooth logo upp in right corner. 

![Manual](/Documents/Images/app/ccdManual.jpg)

Manual mode view. The joystick is dragged in the direction you want the car to move. The velocity is increased by dragging the orange ball further away from origo. Some MOPEDs had reverse steering input and poorly calibrated steering. Reverse steering checkbox and the two arrows in the upper corners solve this issue.

![ACC](/Documents/Images/app/ccdACC.jpg)

ACC mode view. The horizontal arrows are used for calibrating the steering and the vertical arrows are used to set maxspeed when driving in ACC mode. 

![Platoon](/Documents/Images/app/ccdPlatoon.jpg)

Platooning mode view. The arrows are used to calibrate steering due to poorly calibrated MOPEDs.
